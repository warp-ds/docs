# Welcome

## Intro
Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the WARP design system. 

**WARP design system**
Whether you are a novice or an expert working with design systems, this Figma file contains everything you need to know to get started with using WARP for SMP
WARP serves as a single source of truth for designers, developers, and other stakeholders to ensure consistency and coherence across all brands. 
The goal is to reduce ambiguity, confusion and to save time and resources when building and developing our marketplaces.

## Vision
To create a design system that makes designing and developing in SMP so quick and easy that you'd have to be an idiot not to use it.

* Is easy to use
* Is easy to maintain
* Prioritises simplicity over complexity
* Prioritises quality over speed
* Promotes design consistency
* Meets accessibility guidelines
* Considers the needs of all SMP brands and verticals

**What do you mean slow down, are you crazy!?**
"Successful design systems move more slowly than the products they support. That's a feature, not a bug. The slower pace doesn't mean that design systems have to be a bottleneck to shipping product."
â€” Josh Clark, [Ship faster by building design systems slower](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/design-system-pace-layers-slow-fast.html) on bigmedium.com

**Prioritise Quality over speed**
By taking our time, working thoroughly, and being certain of the decisions we make (through testing and iteration), we are helping to:

* Ensure that our foundation is solid
* Curate quality assured components
* Enable innovation for our users
* ... eventually provide speed for things that have been tried and tested
