# Mission, values, principles

The Warp Design System mission reflecting its values and principles.

## Mission
Our mission is to equip teams with high-quality tools and help them conquer must-win battles.

## Vision
Our vision is to be an inclusive design system that helps teams maintain consistency and minimize waste with clearly defined building blocks. We provide efficient tools to succeed through structured flexibility.

## Values
Our values drive to create things with humility, clarity, accessibility, collaboration and intent in mind.

- **Humility:** we acknowledge that building and using a system properly is hard. Users do their best to understand every implication of the system â€“ we do our best to help them understand.

- **Clarity:** we avoid ambiguity. We help people act with confidence by clarifying the details and eliminating doubt.

- **Accessibility:** we provide quality through clear standards, and we go beyond compliance and bare minimums.

- **Collaboration:** we recognize the importance of contributions, and we actively build a thriving community.

- **Intent:** we make decisions confidently and with clear intent, and we don't shy away from them in fear of failure. We celebrate and learn from our mistakes.


## Principles
Our principles direct our actions to ensure they reflect our values.

- **Composability over rigidity:** we believe in structured flexibility and we offer it by breaking down building blocks into smaller parts. We believe that opinionated but adaptable building blocks provide sufficient consistency without being overly rigid. We focus on building modular rather than rigid components with complicated configurations.

- **Quality & stability over quantity & speed:** we invest time and effort to equip product teams with the tools they need to speed up their process rather than chasing quick wins. We minimize waste by thoroughly codifying patterns. We make sure our existing components maintain high quality before creating new ones.

- **Accessibility over aesthetics:** we focus on inclusive rather than visually dazzling patterns and elements. We ensure quality through clear standards for accessibility. We strive to go beyond compliance and bare minimums to lay a foundation for true inclusivity.

- **Coherence over infinite freedom:** we take care of the complexity and do the heavy lifting so you don't have to. We help teams maintain consistency and a holistic user experience. We optimize the system by learning about the needs of product teams rather than solving their problems.

- **Community over isolation:** we maintain and govern the system to ensure a holistic product experience. We fail and learn together with the teams rather than chasing dreams of technical excellence in isolation. We foster a strong community of people rather than a walled garden of technology.
