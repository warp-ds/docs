# Migrate from Fabric
All design files needs to be converted to be using WARP components and styles in order for all Schibsted Marketplaces to work in the design system.

## Migration
Fabric (the old FINN design system) is being replaced by WARP. You will have to recreate your design files in order for WARP to work, nothing will be migrated automatically. It's up to you if you want to start fresh in a new document or replace component by component.

Make sure all Fabric libraries are disabled so you don't accidentally use styles or components that are not connected to WARP.

**FINN first**
The default styling for all components in WARP is FINN, you can switch to other brands whenever you want thanks to Figma variables and tokens.
