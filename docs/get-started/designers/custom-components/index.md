# Building custom components with WARP
If you are building a component that doesn't exist in WARP you can still use semantic tokens and get support for dark mode and all other SMP brands for free.

## Semantic tokens
Semantic tokens are not connected to any specific component and can be used to create custom designs that are still multi-brand friendly.

### Access the semantic tokens
You find the semantic tokens in the right sidebar and they practically work like a normal Figma style.

You can find an overview of our semantic tokens here: [foundations > tokens > overview](../../../foundations/tokens/overview/index.md)

### Switch modes
Connecting the design tokens to Figma variables makes it possible to easily switch between brands and light/dark modes. You can do this by selecting an element using WARP tokens and using the right sidebar to switch modes within "Appearance"
