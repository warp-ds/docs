## Semantic tokens
TODO: description

### Custom components and design
Semantic tokens are not connected to any specific component and can be used to create custom designs that are still multi-brand friendly.

If you are building a component that doesn't exist in WARP you can still use semantic tokens and get support for dark mode and all other SMP brands for free.

### Access the semantic tokens
You find the semantic tokens in the right sidebar and they practically work like a normal Figma style.

We are working on a more in-depth guide on semantic tokens, it will be linked from here.
