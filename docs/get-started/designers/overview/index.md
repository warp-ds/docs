**Design tokens**
We’re using Figma variables in WARP where we gather all tokens for all brands, however not all type of tokens are supported by Figma yet, one of those things are typography, which is why we still need to have a design tokens file per brand.These files will most likely be deprecated during 2024 as Figma continuously are releasing updates to the variables functionality.
