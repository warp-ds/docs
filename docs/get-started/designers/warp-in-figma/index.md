### Libraries
Components: The latest version of the WARP component library, contains themeable components that are usable by all Schibsted Marketplaces

Design tools: Generic design elements that you can use in presentations, mockups, or to help organise things in your Figma files

Icons: A large icon library containing all old Fabric icons and newer ones

Components (deprecated): An old version of the WARP component library, this will be phased out and should not be used in newer projects

### Example pages
A collection of example pages that shows brand specific tokens in play. Use it to reverse engineer the WARP design tokens if you will!
These files will most likely be deprecated during 2024 as Figma continuously are releasing updates to the variables functionality.

## Libraries
In order to use the WARP design system properly you need to enable our libraries.
### Libraries needed
The components and icon libraries are automatically added to every new Figma file created in SMP.

#### Enabled libraries
We've automatically added the following libraries whenever you create a new file within the Nordic Marketplaces organisation:

* Warp - Components
* Warp - Icons

### Removing other libraries

You might want to consider disabling other libraries to not accidentally pick any non-WARP components. All WARP libraries are marked with the "Warp"-prefix.
