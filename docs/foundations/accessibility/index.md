# Accessibility
Designing and building for accessibility will make our products better for more people.

## A11y in WARP
### Requirements in SMP
The products we build in SMP should be accessible and inclusive for everyone. SMP should meet WCAG 2.2 AA requirements.

We’re aiming for WARP to meet the accessibility standards and component and style we provide should be accessible.

### Accessibility playbook
The SMP a11y team is working on a playbook which contains what we need to know in order to work efficiently with accessibility. We will link to that here when available.

We’ll update this space with WARP specific accessibility information when the playbook is released.

### Colour contrast
There are a few things we need to test for when it comes to accessibility. 
One of the main things you as a designer can do is to make sure the colour contrasts are good enough.

The contrast between text and the background should be at least 4.5:1.There are many plugins for checking contrast, some popular ones are Contrast & Stark.
