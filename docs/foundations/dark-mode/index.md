### Support in WARP
All components and tokens in WARP are built with dark mode in mind. Therefore there’s not much you need to consider when creating your designs.

## Figma: Switch to dark mode

### Switching modes
You can switch to dark mode whenever you want, either for a specific component or an entire frame. This is available in the right sidebar.

It’s always a good idea to see what your designs look like in dark mode to make sure colour contrasts are good enough and that illustrations and graphics are optimised for a darker setting.
