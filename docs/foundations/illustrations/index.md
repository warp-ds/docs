Illustrations and WARP

## Illustrations in WARP
WARP currently doesnâ€™t support illustrations. Please use the existing brand specific illustration libraries.

If an illustration will be used in dark mode make sure you have a variant that looks good in that setting. Consult a visual designer working with that brand for further help.
