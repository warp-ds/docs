# Components for data visualisation

## Code

There is no WARP component library for data visualisation. For web, the JavaScript library you use typically takes care of all the parts of a visualisation.

### Which JavaScript library should you use for charts?
There are many JavaScript libraries available, such as [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com), [D3](https://d3js.org/), [visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) and [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com/). 

Product teams in Vend use a variety of charting libraries, and we have not decided on a recommended library. This is not straightforward, as different teams might have unique chart requrements.

Make sure to check if the library allows you to follow the [Success criteria](/foundations/data-visualization/success-criteria/), for example for screen reader accessibility.
