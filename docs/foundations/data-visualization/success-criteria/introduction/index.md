# Introduction to Dataviz Success Sriteria

The following success criteria will help you create graphs that effectively communicate insights and are accessible for everyone. Some criteria are most relevant for designers, while others are more relevant for developers.

The criteria are put into four categories:
- **Cognitive**: Is the graph understandable for everyone?
- **Visual**: Are the visual elements possible to perceive for everyone?
- **Keyboard**: Can interactive charts be operated using keyboard navigation?
- **Screen reader**: Is all the information accessible for people using a screen reader?

The success criteria are adapted from accessibility criteria formulated by [Sarah Fossheim](http://fossheim.io/), based on [WCAG success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and inspired by the [Chartability](https://chartability.fizz.studio/) framework.
