### Use `Line` and `Background` colours for points

- Points are often combined with lines in a chart, and therefore we use the same colour for lines and points 
- To use the Line colour on points in Figma, the points need to have a stroke (like a donut üç©). If you don‚Äôt want a donut with space in the middle, make the stroke thicker
- Points (or lines around points) should have a width of minimum 3 px to ensure sufficient contrast against the background
- If you go for the donut variant, use either `ChartBackground/Default` or a `Background/Subtle` fill colour
