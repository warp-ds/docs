### Use the `Line` colours for lines

- Lines should have a width of minimum **3 px** to ensure sufficient contrast against the background
- **Straight lines** are usually better than smooth curves, as curves can be misinterpreted as representing data values or trends that are not present in the data
- Consider adding **dashed stroke** for lines when you include lines of different colours. Dashed lines appear less important than solid lines, and are therefore well suited for secondary information
- Adding **points along lines** can help users understand where the actual data points are placed, and that the line is simply a interpolation between points.
