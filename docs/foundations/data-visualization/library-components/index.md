# Library & Components

## Which visualisation library should you use?
There are many JavaScript libraries available, such as [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com), [D3](https://d3js.org/), [visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) and [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com/). 

We have not (yet) decided on a recommended charting library. Make sure to check if the library allows you to follow the [Success criteria](/foundations/data-visualization/success-criteria/), for example for screen reader accessibility.
