# Lines & Points (dataviz)

*For implementation, see [Tokens & CSS > Line](/foundations/data-visualization/tokens/line/).*

## Lines

- Use the `Line` colors for lines.
- Lines should have a width of minimum **3 px** to ensure sufficient contrast against the background
- **Straight lines** are usually better than smooth curves, as curves can be misinterpreted as representing data values or trends that are not present in the data
- Consider adding **dashed stroke** for lines when you include lines of different colors. Dashed lines appear less important than solid lines, and are therefore well suited for secondary information
- Adding **points along lines** can help users understand where the actual data points are placed, and that the line is simply a interpolation between points.

## Points

- Use the `Line` colors for points. Points are often combined with lines in a chart, and therefore we use the same color for lines and points 
- To use the Line color on points in **Figma**, the points need to have a **stroke** (like a donut üç©). If you don‚Äôt want a donut with space in the middle, make the stroke thicker
- Points (or lines around points) should have a width of minimum **3 px** to ensure sufficient contrast against the background.

### 'Donut' points 

If you go for the donut variant of points, use either `ChartBackground/Default` or a `Background Subtle` as the fill color.

An advantage of using `Background Subtle` is that it becomes logical to use `Background Subtle-Highlight` when interacting with the points.

## Line dashes and point shapes

**Line dashes** can make it easier to distinguish between categories, benefiting people with color deficiencies as well as those printing in gray scale. For example, it makes sense to use a solid stroke style for the primary line using the Primary color, and dashes for the secondary line using the secondary color.

For points, consider using different **point shapes** for each category. However, using many different point shapes can make the graph appear disorienting and chaotic, and thereby work against its intended purpose. One acceptable solution is to **show point shapes on interaction**, like hover and focus. Different dataviz libraries might have specific options for point shapes, so it might be useful to consider the technical possibilities before choosing shapes.
