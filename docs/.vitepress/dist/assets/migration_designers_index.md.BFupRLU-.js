In the beginning you will find mostly Fabric or Blocket in the search results components (if you haven’t turned those libraries off) since Figma remembers what you’ve worked with before. You can also copy and paste components directly from the Warp components overview if you prefer that.</p><p>We strongly recommend that you recreate your screens with the FINN theme in place to make sure you get a 1:1 experience of your screens. If you find that you can’t create the same design since you have made something custom, try to find components that you can use instead. If you can’t, reach out to us!</p><h3 id="_4-duplicate-your-finn-styled-warp-file" tabindex="-1">4.

We are no longer picking colors from a palette (like <code>text-blue-600</code>), but instead we use colors based on their purpose (like <code>text-primary</code>). This is something we do because we need to support theming/dark mode.</p>',20),s=[n];function l(h,c,p,d,g,m){return t(),i("div",null,s)}const f=e(a,[["render",l]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
