### Import

<warp-react-beta-note />

You can import the component like so:
```js
import { Button } from '@warp-ds/components/react/button';
```

### Syntax

```jsx example
<Button>Default</Button>
```

### Visual options

#### Primary

The primary button is a call to action. As a general rule, there should only be
one of them on the screen. This guides the user towards the happy path.

```jsx example
<Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
```

#### Negative

Used for destructive actions, like deletion. Shouldn't be used on the same
screen as a primary button.

```jsx example
<Button variant="negative">Negative</Button>
```

#### Secondary

Secondary buttons are without background, and are often used for secondary actions.
This is the default, so you may simply omit the secondary property unless you want to use it with `quiet` variation.

```jsx example
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
```

#### Utility
The `utility` button.

```jsx example
<Button variant="utility">Utility</Button>
```

#### Link
Button to look like a link, use the `link` property.

```jsx example
<Button variant="link">button</Button>
```

#### Negative Quiet
The `negativeQuiet` button.

```jsx example
<Button variant="negativeQuiet">Negative-Quiet</Button>
```

#### Utility Quiet
The `utilityQuiet` button.

```jsx example
<Button variant="utilityQuiet">utility-Quiet</Button>
```


#### Loading/In progress

Used for visual feedback that the action the user triggered is loading.

```jsx example
<Button loading>Default loading</Button>
```

#### Small

```jsx example
<Button size="small">Default small</Button>
```

#### Full width
The fullWidth prop sets the button's width to its parent's width. 

```jsx example
<Button fullWidth>Full width</Button>
```
