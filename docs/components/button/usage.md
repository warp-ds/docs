## Button Usage

<component-design-guidelines name="Warp - Components / Button" link="https://www.figma.com/file/nkiRpuVu6XRfvY96BA80H8/Components-overview?type=design&node-id=384-34743&mode=design" />

### Button Accessibility
If the button doesn't have visible text content, such as when used with only an
icon, an `aria-label` prop must be provided for accessibility.
