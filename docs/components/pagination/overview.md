# Pagination - Overview
Pagination is used to split up long datasets into multiple 'pages'.

## General
Pagination is used on various listing pages. It's typically found at the end of search result pages, My Ads, Favorite lists, or anywhere a long list of items are divided up and presented to users over multiple pages. Since pagination is a fairly basic and familiar feature, it's reasonable to expect that users would benefit from a consistent design and behaviour. Consistency reduces cognitive load, which in turn leads to less frustrated and more happy users.
