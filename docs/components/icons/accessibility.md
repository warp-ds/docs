### Alt texts

To support screen readers and improve accessibility, all icons include meaningful and concise alt text. We’ve refined our alt text descriptions to focus on what the icon visually depicts, rather than abstract or technical labels.

For example: Instead of using "AgricultureMachine", the alt text is now simply "Tractor" — a more intuitive and recognizable description for screen reader users.

This approach ensures that users relying on assistive technologies can easily understand the visual content and its purpose.
