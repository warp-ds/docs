# Page indicator - Accessibility
A page indicator shows the total amount of pages (or images) and the current page using dots.

## General
When using page indicators, be mindful of the background colour that will be used behind them. If there is a chance the contrast between the indicators and the background is too low, then place the indicators below, and outside of the content container.
