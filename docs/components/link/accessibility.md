Link component to use when creating links that look like buttons.

### Mouse navigation

- Cursor change and underline on hover on web.

### Keyboard navigation

- Ensure links receive Warp’s global focus indicator styling when navigating with a keyboard.

### Voiceover / screen reader

- Screen readers expect links and buttons to behave differently. Misusing them can be disorienting.
- Screen reader users often navigate via link lists, so avoid vague labels like "read more" or "click here".
- Links must have appropriate link text that is sufficiently descriptive, giving users enough information to understand where the link will take them.
