## Accessibility guidelines

For accessibility guidelines related to code, refer to the Code section.

### Mouse navigation

- Cursor change and underline on hover on web.

### Keyboard navigation

- Ensure links receive Warpâ€™s global focus indicator styling when navigating with a keyboard.

### Voiceover / screen reader

- Screen readers expect links and buttons to behave differently. Misusing them can be disorienting.
- Screen reader users often navigate via link lists, so avoid vague labels like "read more" or "click here".
- Links must have appropriate link text that is sufficiently descriptive, giving users enough information to understand where the link will take them.
