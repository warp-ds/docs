# Broadcast - Overview
Broadcast automatically fetches broadcast messages for the current (or a given) url.

<ComponentsStatus />

## General
Uses toast apis under the hood.

**N.B.** Broadcast should only be included once per page to avoid duplicate broadcast messages being displayed. The preferred method for including broadcast is to use the [broadcast-podlet](https://github.schibsted.io/finn/broadcast-podlet) provided by the communication team.

## Example

See the [toast component](/components/toast/) for examples, as `broadcast` utilizes it to display messages.
