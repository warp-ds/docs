# Modal - Accessibility
A modal is a focused dialog that temporarily blocks the interface to request a specific decision or input. Because it pauses the experience, use it sparingly for high-priority tasks.

## General
Modal needs either aria-label or aria-labelledby to be accessible to screen readers.

All dialogs must have a title. Titles appear in bold at the top of the dialog and use a few words to convey the outcome of what will happen if a user continues with an action. Use the property title for this.
