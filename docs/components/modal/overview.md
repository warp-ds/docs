# Modal - Overview
A modal is a focused dialog that temporarily blocks the interface to request a specific decision or input. Because it pauses the experience, use it sparingly for high-priority tasks.

## Example
<ThemeSwitcher />
<modal-example />

## General
A modal overlays the page and prevents interaction with the underlying UI until the user completes an action (for example, confirm, cancel, or provide required input). This interruption is useful for time-sensitive or high-impact decisions, but it can be disruptive if overused. When a modal is necessary, keep content concise, make the primary action clear, offer a safe dismiss option, and avoid stacking multiple modals.
