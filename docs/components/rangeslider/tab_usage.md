## Best practices / usage guidelines

- Sliders are best suited for cases where people need to quickly set a value within a known range. They offer an intuitive way to adjust settings like volume, price filters, or relative distances.
- Use step intervals (integers) when precision input is required.
- Ensure the slider is wide enough to be easily interacted with on touch devices.
- Use a tooltip to show the selected value.

### When to use

- Use when selecting a range of number values.
- Use sliders when there is a need to show a selection of a range of values.
- Use when needing to expose a variety of options or to limit the number of options quickly.

### When not to use

- Do not use ranges that are too small, for example, 1-3.
- Do not use complex inputted values that are not numbers.
