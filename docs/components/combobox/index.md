A combo box is the combination of an `<input type="text"/>` and a list.
The list is designed to help the user arrive at a value, but the value does not necessarily have to come from that list.
Don't think of it like a `<select/>`, but more of an input with some suggestions.
You can, however, validate that the value comes from the list, that's up to your app.
