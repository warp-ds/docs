# Box - Accessibility
Box is a layout component used for separating content areas on a page.

## General
Use the ARIA `role` attribute to provide semantic meaning to a Box element.
If no role property is supplied, it will default to `role="region"`.
To remove the default role attribute, supply an empty role (`role=""`).
Consider using more suitable roles for your specific Box, as described on
[MDN WAI-ARIA Roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles#aria_role_types).
