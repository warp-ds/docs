Badges are small, contextual elements used to display concise, informative labels. They highlight relevant information such as statuses, categories, counts, roles, or activity indicators, helping users quickly identify and differentiate items at a glance.

### Sponsored

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-24">
  <div class="py-16">
    <img src="/components/badge/badge-variants-sponsored.svg" alt="Sponsored badge" />
  </div>

  <div>The sponsored badge is used to indicate that a particular ad appears at the top of a list due to plaid placement by the seller. This variant is reserved exclusively for this use case and should not be used in any other context.
  </div>
</div>

### Price

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-24">
  <div class="py-16">
    <img src="/components/badge/badge-variants-price.svg" alt="Price badge" />
  </div>

  <div>The primary purpose of the price badge is to display prices across user journeys. However, this variant can also be used in cases where it needs to stand out prominently on the screen. It features a darker background, creating stronger contrast with the content behind it. While the variant is currently named “price,” its applications extend beyond pricing alone, so the description should reflect its broader use cases.
  </div>
</div>

### Disabled

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-24">
  <div class="py-16">
    <img src="/components/badge/badge-variants-disabled.svg" alt="Disabled badge" />
  </div>

  <div>The disabled badge indicates an inactive state. It should be used when a feature or item exists but is not currently active—for example, when a user has created a draft ad that hasn't been published or made publicly visible. This badge helps communicate that the item is present but not in effect, and no immediate action can be taken.
  </div>
</div>
