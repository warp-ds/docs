# Badge - Accessibility

Badges are small, contextual elements used to display concise, informative labels. They highlight relevant information such as statuses, categories, counts, roles, or activity indicators, helping users quickly identify and differentiate items at a glance.

Visually styled and colour-coded to indicate contextual metadata.

## General

By itself, the badge component only provides a consistent visual styling to text. Product teams should consider how the badges will be used, and how to provide semantic/programmatic information for screen reader users.
