#### 3rd <kbd>Tab</kbd> key
Focus moves to the **year** field (“yyyy”), allowing the user to manually enter a year.

Pressing <kbd aria-label="Arrow Up">↑</kbd> or <kbd aria-label="Arrow Down">↓</kbd> increments or decrements the year (starting from the current year).

## VoiceOver / Screen Reader

It's not necessary to explain how to use, open, or close the date picker when the text field receives focus — as long as its behavior is intuitive and accessible.
