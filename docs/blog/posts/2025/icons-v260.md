5 new icons, and some maintenance
---

We have added **5 new icons** :tada:, in 3 sizes (16, 24 and 32px)!

List of the newcomers, including the requested drag-dots icon:

<ul>
<li>CarLeft</li>
<li>CarRight</li>
<li>PlaneLand</li>
<li>PlaneTakeOff</li>
<li>DragDots</li>
</ul>

<br />
Additionally, these changes have been made on the code side of the repository:

- lingui files have been moved from individual icon directories to a separate locales directory: this is not a breaking change for users.
- added inline JSDoc typings to icon React components for improved autocomplete and prop hints in JavaScript editors — via user contribution! ⭐

<br />

You can see all available icons in our documentation [here](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/icons/).
