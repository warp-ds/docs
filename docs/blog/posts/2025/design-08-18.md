Warp Figma Component Library updates

We’ve made several updates to the WARP Component Library in Figma to better align with implementation and improve usability.

## Toast
- Updated for consistency with web. You can now edit the text and toggle the close button from Figma’s right side panel.
- Set a min width of 328px and max of 420px for improved readability on wide viewports.
- Updated Figma component description with a link to the WARP Portal.
- Updated WARP Portal documentation - [Toast documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/toast/)
