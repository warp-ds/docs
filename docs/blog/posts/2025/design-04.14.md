We just published some Figma Component Library Updates. All of these changes are also published and available in code.

## Component updates

### Button
- Added the ability to have a trailing icon
- Now button has both “Leading” and “Trailing” icon props to turn on/off these icons

### Tooltip
- Added a “No arrow” variant
- Renamed “Pointer” property to “Arrow” to align with code
- The “No arrow” variant is something that we’re using in a revamped Slider which is coming soon.
