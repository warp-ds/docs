## Warp Figma Component Library updates

We've made several updates to the Warp Component Library in Figma to better align with implementation and improve usability.

### Neutral mode updates
- **Blue primitives updated:** Replaced the former Oikotie Blue with Blocket Blue.
- **Token changes:** `Semantic/Colour/Background/Primary`, `Semantic/Colour/Background/Selected` and `Semantic/Color/Text/Link` tokens updated to Blue (previously Gray) to better support Backoffice systems.
- **Figma library updates:** Neutral theme added to Typography overview, Component overview (light/dark), and as example variations across all component pages.

### Accessible border tokens
- **New tokens added:** `Semantic/Color/Border/Strong` and `Semantic/Color/Border/Strong-Hover` to improve accessibility and ensure consistent contrast for interactive components.
- **Updates to components:** Tokens applied to Default and Hover states of Checkbox, Radio, Text Area, Text Field, and Select.
- **Important:** Buttons intentionally continue using `Semantic/Color/Border/Default` tokens (`Secondary` and `Utility` variants).

## Warp Figma Icon Library updates

All regular icons and "taxonomy icons" are now proportionally scalable in both stroke width and size. The full set of 259 icons is now consolidated under Regular icons. We've also expanded Figma keywords to make icons easier to findâ€”for example, the Bin icon is now searchable with "Trash, Remove, Recycle, Delete."

**Update highlights:**
- 27 new icons (included product team requests, like `Shrink`, `Confetti`, `BriefcaseUser`, `CalendarPlus` and refreshed taxonomy icons such as `Guitar`, `Sofa` and `Drill`).
- 38 outdated taxonomy icons removed (the old 42x28px style that wasn't scalable). All icons in use were redrawn in the square and proportionally scalable style.
- 17 duplicate/near-identical icons removed to streamline the library and reduce confusion.
- 18 icons visually updated with minor tweaks for design coherence (e.g. `AnimalPaw`, `Tractor`, `Phone`, `PlaneTakeOff`).
- 13 icons renamed for clarity, based on what they visually represent, rather than product-specific terms (e.g. "AgriculturalMachine" = `Tractor`, "Service" = `Wrench`).
